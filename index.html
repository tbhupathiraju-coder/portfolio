            <h2>Social Hierarchy Behavior</h2>
            <p>The Eastern Cottontail is generally quiet, except when they are mating and raising the young cottontails. That is when the older Eastern Cottontail make their social hierarchy. This leads to aggressiveness, chasing, and more rarely - fighting. Dominant displaces subordinates, meaning that there is a winner and a loser. The dominant males will do the most work and breeding, but won't care for them afterwards.</p>
